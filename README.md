# fastai-vision-docker

This is a docker container with fastai core and text(spacy) libraries installed using conda. This can be used as a base container for deploying prediction workflows. The pre-built container is available [on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/beapen/fastai-text) as beapen/fastai-text:latest

[Here is a OpenFaaS template](https://github.com/dermatologist/python3-ml) that uses this container as the base for easy serverless deployment. [Read more about OpenFaas](https://www.openfaas.com/).
